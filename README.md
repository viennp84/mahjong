# Introduction of the game and the application:
<p> Playing games is a common entertainment activity that everyone would like to spend time with their family and friends. This project aims to create a game environment for Mahjong players to play via a virtual game table. Mahjong is a traditional game in China that requires player strategy and luck to win. The game now becomes popular in the game community as it not only a fun game and tight-up socializing between players. Game rules are complicated and vary on the game versions, countries, groups where players actually can define their own rules on the general rules. Hosting a mahjong game is basically difficult as people have to equip an expensive mahjong set and an inconvenient game table to carry with four players. Gathering enough players for hosting a game event even more challenging because everyone has their own daily schedule, or physical distance does not allow them to host a game.
Mahjong game online is purposely created to provide a better condition for the mahjong players to play with their crew anytime, anywhere on a mobile device as long as they have an internet connection. Hopefully, this application will be a small social website connecting mahjong players to share the beauty of an interesting game.</p>
